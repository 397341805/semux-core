# Semux Virtual Machine

Semux VM will be launched with the 1.5.0 release.  It is currently available in the [Testnet](./Testnet.md)

It utilizes the well known ethereum VM format/language for contracts.

It uses gas and gas prices in the same mechanism as used for ethereum.

It supports all of the Byzantium ethereum constructs, as well as two new calls specific to Semux, Vote and Unvote.
